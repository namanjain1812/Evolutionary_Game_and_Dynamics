# Evolutionary Game and Dynamics

Part of my research project done under Prof. Sagar Chakraborty on the topic "Chaos and rationality in evolutionary games"

In this project we computationally verified the existence of chaotic strange attractor in case of replicator dynamics for a four strategy evolutionary game. Further we analyzed the normal form sampling dynamics, symmetized bimatrix best response dynamics and symmetrized bimatrix sampling dynamics by plotting their dynamics on a simplex. These plots can be used to study the stability if rest points and check whether chaos exist in such situations.
